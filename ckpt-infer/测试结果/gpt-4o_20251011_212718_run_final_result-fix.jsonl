The result is a single binomial coefficient that combines all parameters.\n\n- **Key Step Explanations**: The key step is recognizing that the sum over \\(\\alpha_1\\) with the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{\\alpha_1 + n_1}{n_1}\\) can be combined with the result of the induction hypothesis to form a single binomial coefficient, as per the lemma mentioned.\n\n### Verification\n\nThe restored expression is reasonable because it follows from the application of a known combinatorial identity (Vandermonde's identity) and matches the structure of the problem.

Performing$k+1$times the integration by parts on~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u}, each time using the next derivative of$v$and the next antiderivative of$W$, yields the formula\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint}\n \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} v^{(0)} W^{(0)}\\diff u = \\sum_{m = 0}^{k} (-1)^m \\left[ W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\!+ (-1)^{k+1} \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} W^{(k+1)} v^{(k+1)}\\diff u \\;,\n\\end{align}where the dependence on$u$was omitted for the sake of brevity. The integral on the right-hand side of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:partint} vanishes together with$v^{(k+1)}$, and each summand of the remaining boundary terms can be evaluated individually to\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint:summand}\n (-1)^m \\left[W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_1^{(1\\!-\\!x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\! &= \\left[ - (1\\!-\\!x)^{-(m+1)} \\tfrac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m + 1)!

We evaluate this integral using$(k+1)$-times repeated integration by parts. The integrand of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u} is given by the product of the functions\\begin{align}\nv^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{u^k}{k!}\\\\\n W^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{N!} (1 - (1-x)u)^N \\;.\n\\end{align}For$v$, we can immediately compute its$m$-th derivatives\\begin{align}\nv^{(m)}(u) := \\td{^m}{u^m} v^{(0)}(u) = \\frac{u^{k-m}}{(k-m)!} && m = 0, \\dots, k\n\\end{align}and the$(k+1)$-th derivative is zero.

The integral on the right-hand side of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:partint} vanishes together with$v^{(k+1)}$, and each summand of the remaining boundary terms can be evaluated individually to\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint:summand}\n (-1)^m \\left[W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_1^{(1\\!-\\!x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\! &= \\left[ - (1\\!-\\!x)^{-(m+1)} \\tfrac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m + 1)!

For the special case$q = 0$, a straightforward induction procedure shows that the$M$-th derivative of$g(x) = (1-x)^{-(1+k)}$is\\begin{align}\ng^{(M)}(x) := \\td{^M}{x^M} (1 - x)^{- (1 + k)} = \\frac{(M + k )!}{k!} (1 - x)^{-(M + k + 1)} && \\text{~for all~} M \\in \\Nspace \\;.\n\\end{align}Evaluated at zero, these derivatives define the Taylor formula\\begin{align}\ng(x) = (1-x)^{-(k+1)} = \\sum_{M = 0}^N \\frac{(M + k )!}{k!} \\frac{x^M}{M!} + R_N(x)\\;,\n\\end{align}where$N \\in \\Nspace$is the maximum degree of the Taylor polynomial and$R_N(x)$is the remainder. The Taylor remainder in integral form~\\cite{Oberguggenberger2018} is given by\\begin{align}\nR_N(x) &= \\int_{0}^x \\frac{(x - \\tau)^N}{N!} g^{(N+1)}(\\tau) \\diff \\tau = \\int_0^x \\frac{(x - \\tau)^N}{N!} \\frac{(N+1 + k)!}{k!} (1 - \\tau)^{-(2 + k + N)} \\diff \\tau\\;.\n\\end{align}The substitution$u = (1-\\tau)^{-1}$of the integration variable simplifies this integral to\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u}\n R_N(x) &= \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} \\frac{u^k}{k!} \\, \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{N!} \\, (1 - (1-x)u)^N \\diff u \\;,\n\\end{align}which is an integral over a polynomial in$u$. We evaluate this integral using$(k+1)$-times repeated integration by parts. The integrand of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u} is given by the product of the functions\\begin{align}\nv^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{u^k}{k!}\\\\\n W^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{N!} (1 - (1-x)u)^N \\;.\n\\end{align}For$v$, we can immediately compute its$m$-th derivatives\\begin{align}\nv^{(m)}(u) := \\td{^m}{u^m} v^{(0)}(u) = \\frac{u^{k-m}}{(k-m)!} && m = 0, \\dots, k\n\\end{align}and the$(k+1)$-th derivative is zero. The function$W^{(0)}$has the$m$-th antiderivative\\begin{align}\nW^{(m)}(u) := (x-1)^{-m} \\, \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m)!} \\, (1 - (1-x) u)^{N+m}\n\\end{align}such that$\\td{^m}{u^m} W^{(m)}(u) = W^{(0)}(u)$for$m = 0, \\dots, k+1$. Performing$k+1$times the integration by parts on~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u}, each time using the next derivative of$v$and the next antiderivative of$W$, yields the formula\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint}\n \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} v^{(0)} W^{(0)}\\diff u = \\sum_{m = 0}^{k} (-1)^m \\left[ W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\!+ (-1)^{k+1} \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} W^{(k+1)} v^{(k+1)}\\diff u \\;,\n\\end{align}where the dependence on$u$was omitted for the sake of brevity. The integral on the right-hand side of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:partint} vanishes together with$v^{(k+1)}$, and each summand of the remaining boundary terms can be evaluated individually to\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint:summand}\n (-1)^m \\left[W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_1^{(1\\!-\\!x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\! &= \\left[ - (1\\!-\\!x)^{-(m+1)} \\tfrac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m + 1)! (k - m)!} (1 \\!-\\!

To show that the remainder converges to zero as$N \\rightarrow \\infty$, we will proceed to bound the expression~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder} from above. To lighten notation, we assume w.l.o.g that$x > 0$(otherwise, replace$x$by$\\abs{x}$and$R_N(x)$by$\\abs{R_N(x)}$in the developments below). From the factorial expressions it is easy to see that\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:factorials}\n \\binom{N + k + 1}{N + m + 1} = \\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\binom{k} {m} \\binom{N + m + 1}{m}^{-1} \\;.\n\\end{align}Noting that$\\binom{N + m + 1}{m}^{-1} \\leq 1$for all$m \\in \\Nspace$, we substitute~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:factorials} into the remainder~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder} and use the binomial theorem to obtain\\begin{align}\nR_N(x) &\\leq x^N \\frac{x}{1-x}\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\sum_{m = 0}^k \\binom{k} {m} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m} 1 ^{k-m} \\nonumber \\\\\n & = \\frac{x^{N+1}}{(1-x)}\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x} + 1\\right)^k \\nonumber \\\\\n & = \\frac{x^{N+1}}{(1-x)^{k+1}}\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\;.\n\\end{align}Finally, using the bound$\\binom{N+1+k}{k} \\leq (N+1)^{k+1}$, we find for any fixed$k \\in \\Nspace$\\begin{align}\n0 \\leq \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} R_N(x) \\leq \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} x^{N+1} \\left(\\frac{N+1}{1-x}\\right)^{k+1} = 0 \\;,\n\\end{align}completing the proof.\n\\end{proof}", "formula_index": 18, "line_index": 0, "env": "align", "relative_mask_position": 0.605369, "sample_index": 3, "model_responses": [{"response": "**[MASK]_1 Restoration Result:**\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = 0}^{k} (-1)^m \\left[ \\frac{(1-x)^{N+m+1}}{(x-1)^{m+1}} \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{(N+m+1)!} \\frac{1}{(k-m)!} \\right]_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}}\n\\]\n\n**Derivation Basis:**\n1. **Integration by Parts**: The integration by parts formula is used repeatedly to evaluate the integral.

Specifically, the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{r}$ is defined as $\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, and it can be bounded by $\\frac{n^r}{r!}$ for $r \\leq n$.\n- **Logical relationship with preceding text**: The proof aims to show that the remainder $R_N(x)$ converges to zero as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$. To achieve this, the expression involving the binomial coefficient needs to be bounded from above. The inequality $\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\leq \\frac{(N + k + 1)^{k+1}}{(k+1)!}$ provides such a bound, which is crucial for demonstrating the convergence of the remainder.\n- **Key step explanations for the derivation**: The inequality is derived by recognizing that the binomial coefficient can be expressed in terms of factorials and then applying a standard bounding technique for binomial coefficients.

The expression $\\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1}$ arises from the evaluation of the boundary terms at the limits of integration.\n\n**Verification:**\n- The restoration result is consistent with the logical flow of the proof, where the remainder $R_N(x)$ is expressed as a series involving powers of $x$ and binomial coefficients.\n- The expression correctly reflects the dependence on $x^N$, which is typical for Taylor remainders as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n- The use of binomial coefficients and the factor $\\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1}$ aligns with the integration by parts process and the simplification of factorial expressions.", "reasoning": null}], "extract_answers": [{"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+1} \\binom{k}{m}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^{N+1} \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}, {"mask_id": "1", "formula": "R_N(x) = x^N \\sum_{m=0}^{k} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1}"}], "original_index": 17}
