The Taylor remainder in integral form~\\cite{Oberguggenberger2018} is given by\\begin{align}\nR_N(x) &= \\int_{0}^x \\frac{(x - \\tau)^N}{N!} g^{(N+1)}(\\tau) \\diff \\tau = \\int_0^x \\frac{(x - \\tau)^N}{N!} \\frac{(N+1 + k)!}{k!} (1 - \\tau)^{-(2 + k + N)} \\diff \\tau\\;.\n\\end{align}The substitution$u = (1-\\tau)^{-1}$of the integration variable simplifies this integral to\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u}\n R_N(x) &= \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} \\frac{u^k}{k!} \\, \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{N!} \\, (1 - (1-x)u)^N \\diff u \\;,\n\\end{align}which is an integral over a polynomial in$u$. We evaluate this integral using$(k+1)$-times repeated integration by parts. The integrand of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u} is given by the product of the functions\\begin{align}\nv^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{u^k}{k!}\\\\\n W^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{N!} (1 - (1-x)u)^N \\;.\n\\end{align}For$v$, we can immediately compute its$m$-th derivatives\\begin{align}\nv^{(m)}(u) := \\td{^m}{u^m} v^{(0)}(u) = \\frac{u^{k-m}}{(k-m)!} && m = 0, \\dots, k\n\\end{align}and the$(k+1)$-th derivative is zero. The function$W^{(0)}$has the$m$-th antiderivative\\begin{align}\nW^{(m)}(u) := (x-1)^{-m} \\, \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m)!} \\, (1 - (1-x) u)^{N+m}\n\\end{align}such that$\\td{^m}{u^m} W^{(m)}(u) = W^{(0)}(u)$for$m = 0, \\dots, k+1$. Performing$k+1$times the integration by parts on~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u}, each time using the next derivative of$v$and the next antiderivative of$W$, yields the formula\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint}\n \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} v^{(0)} W^{(0)}\\diff u = \\sum_{m = 0}^{k} (-1)^m \\left[ W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\!+ (-1)^{k+1} \\int_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} W^{(k+1)} v^{(k+1)}\\diff u \\;,\n\\end{align}where the dependence on$u$was omitted for the sake of brevity. The integral on the right-hand side of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:partint} vanishes together with$v^{(k+1)}$, and each summand of the remaining boundary terms can be evaluated individually to\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:partint:summand}\n (-1)^m \\left[W^{(m+1)} v^{(m)}\\right]_1^{(1\\!-\\!x)^{-1}} \\!\\!\\! &= \\left[ - (1\\!-\\!x)^{-(m+1)} \\tfrac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m + 1)! (k - m)!} (1 \\!-\\! (1\\!-\\!x)u)^{N + m + 1} u^{k - m} \\right]_{1}^{(1-x)^{-1}} \\nonumber \\\\\n &= x^N \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x}\\right)^{m+1} \\binom{N+k+1}{N+m+1} \\;.\n\\end{align}Substituting~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:partint:summand} into~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:partint} yields the desired expression~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder} for the remainder. To show that the remainder converges to zero as$N \\rightarrow \\infty$, we will proceed to bound the expression~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder} from above. To lighten notation, we assume w.l.o.g that$x > 0$(otherwise, replace$x$by$\\abs{x}$and$R_N(x)$by$\\abs{R_N(x)}$in the developments below). From the factorial expressions it is easy to see that\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:lem:series_eval:factorials}\n \\binom{N + k + 1}{N + m + 1} = \\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\binom{k} {m} \\binom{N + m + 1}{m}^{-1} \\;.\n\\end{align}Noting that$\\binom{N + m + 1}{m}^{-1} \\leq 1$for all$m \\in \\Nspace$, we substitute~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:factorials} into the remainder~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder} and use the binomial theorem to obtain\\begin{align}\nR_N(x) &\\leq x^N \\frac{x}{1-x}\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\sum_{m = 0}^k \\binom{k} {m} \\left( \\frac{x}{1-x} \\right)^{m} 1 ^{k-m} \\nonumber \\\\\n & = \\frac{x^{N+1}}{(1-x)}\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\left(\\frac{x}{1-x} + 1\\right)^k \\nonumber \\\\\n & = \\frac{x^{N+1}}{(1-x)^{k+1}}\\binom{N + k + 1}{N + 1} \\;.\n\\end{align}Finally, using the bound$\\binom{N+1+k}{k} \\leq (N+1)^{k+1}$, we find for any fixed$k \\in \\Nspace$\\begin{align}\n0 \\leq \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} R_N(x) \\leq \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} x^{N+1} \\left(\\frac{N+1}{1-x}\\right)^{k+1} = 0 \\;,\n\\end{align}completing the proof.\n\\end{proof}", "formula_index": 0, "line_index": 0, "env": "align", "relative_mask_position": 0.021137, "sample_index": 3, "model_responses": [{"response": "### Restoration of [MASK]_1\n\n**[MASK]_1 Restoration Result:**\n$$\n\\lim_{M \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{a_{M+1}}{a_M} \\right| = |x| < 1\n$$\n\n**Derivation Basis:**\n1. **Mathematical Context**: The proof is about analyzing the convergence of a series (likely related to Taylor series expansion of \\((1-x)^{-(1+k)}\\)).

The function \\( W^{(0)}(u) \\) is given as a polynomial in \\( u \\), and we need its antiderivatives for integration by parts.\n\n2. **Integration by Parts Requirement**: For integration by parts, we need the antiderivative \\( W^{(m)}(u) \\) such that \\( \\frac{d^m}{du^m} W^{(m)}(u) = W^{(0)}(u) \\).

For the special case$q = 0$, a straightforward induction procedure shows that the$M$-th derivative of$g(x) = (1-x)^{-(1+k)}$is\\begin{align}\ng^{(M)}(x) := \\td{^M}{x^M} (1 - x)^{- (1 + k)} = \\frac{(M + k )!}{k!} (1 - x)^{-(M + k + 1)} && \\text{~for all~} M \\in \\Nspace \\;.\n\\end{align}Evaluated at zero, these derivatives define the Taylor formula\\begin{align}\ng(x) = (1-x)^{-(k+1)} = \\sum_{M = 0}^N \\frac{(M + k )!}{k!} \\frac{x^M}{M!} + R_N(x)\\;,\n\\end{align}where$N \\in \\Nspace$is the maximum degree of the Taylor polynomial and$R_N(x)$is the remainder.

We evaluate this integral using$(k+1)$-times repeated integration by parts. The integrand of~\\eqref{eq:lem:series_eval:remainder_u} is given by the product of the functions\\begin{align}\nv^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{u^k}{k!}\\\\\n W^{(0)}(u) &:= \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{N!} (1 - (1-x)u)^N \\;.\n\\end{align}For$v$, we can immediately compute its$m$-th derivatives\\begin{align}\nv^{(m)}(u) := \\td{^m}{u^m} v^{(0)}(u) = \\frac{u^{k-m}}{(k-m)!} && m = 0, \\dots, k\n\\end{align}and the$(k+1)$-th derivative is zero. The function$W^{(0)}$has the$m$-th antiderivative\\begin{align}\nW^{(m)}(u) := (x-1)^{-m} \\, \\frac{(N+k+1)!}{(N + m)!} \\, (1 - (1-x) u)^{N+m}\n\\end{align}such that$\\td{^m}{u^m} W^{(m)}(u) = W^{(0)}(u)$for$m = 0, \\dots, k+1$.

This suggests that $\\xi_{\\vp}(t)$ is derived from integrating a sum involving $\\xi_{[p_2, \\dots, p_m]}(t)$ modulated by $\\ex^{\\ic \\omega p_1 \\tau}$.\n   - The subsequent analysis decomposes the integral into cases ($k = -p_1$ and $k \\neq -p_1$), which aligns with the restored expression.\n\n3. **Key Step Explanations**:\n   - The integral is decomposed into Fourier modes of $\\xi_{[p_2, \\dots, p_m]}(t)$, each multiplied by $\\ex^{\\ic \\omega p_1 \\tau}$ (due to the differential equation from Lemma~\\ref{lem:proof:xi_p:deriv}).\n   - The restored expression naturally leads to the two cases analyzed in the proof: (1) the non-periodic term ($k = -p_1$) and (2) the periodic terms ($k \\neq -p_1$).\n\n### Verification:\n- The restored expression is consistent with the proof's structure:\n  - It incorporates the Fourier series representation of $\\xi_{[p_2, \\dots, p_m]}(t)$.\n  - It aligns with the subsequent analysis of the integral (Equation~\\eqref{eq:openwork:nonperi} and~\\eqref{eq:openwork:peri}).\n  - It maintains symbol consistency (e.g., $\\vp$, $p_1$, $k$, $\\omega$) and mathematical rigor (integration of Fourier series).\n- The form of the integral matches typical derivations in harmonic analysis or dynamical systems where periodic solutions are constructed via Fourier modes. \n\nThus, the restoration is reasonable and fits the proof's logical flow.",
